# Business Data Analysis Project

## What Is This?

Welcome, students! This is a Python project that helps you analyze business data from an Excel file. It reads the data, cleans it up, and shows you cool facts—like which regions and industries in the UK have the most businesses. Plus, it draws a bar chart to make the results easy to see!

Think of it like a detective tool: it takes a messy spreadsheet, organizes it, and finds the big clues for you.

## What’s Inside?
analyze_data.py: The main Python file that does all the work (reading, cleaning, analyzing, and charting).
/data/: A folder where you put your Excel files (like sheet1.xls). This is where the program looks for the data to analyze.

## What You’ll Need
To run this project, you need a few things on your computer:
1. Python
You need Python installed (version 3.6 or higher works best).
Download it from python.org if you don’t have it yet.
2. Python Libraries
These are like extra tools Python uses. You’ll install them with pip (Python’s package manager). Here’s what you need:

pandas: For working with tables (like Excel).
numpy: For math stuff (not used much here, but good to have).
matplotlib: For drawing charts.
xlrd: For reading old .xls Excel files.

# How to Install Them
Open your terminal (or command prompt on Windows) and run these commands one by one:
bash
```
pip install pandas
pip install numpy
pip install matplotlib
pip install xlrd

```

## How to Set It Up
Follow these steps to get started:
Get the Files
Download or clone this project to your computer. You’ll see analyze_data.py and a /data/ folder.
Add Your Data
Put your Excel file (e.g., sheet1.xls) in the /data/ folder.
The default file path in the code is C:\TUL\week4-python-p1\data\sheet1.xls. If your file is somewhere else, update the file_path at the bottom of analyze_data.py to match.
Run the Program
Open your terminal/command prompt.
Go to the project folder by typing something like:
bash
cd C:\TUL\week4-python-p1
Run the script:
bash
python some.py

You’ll see text output (like total businesses and top industries) and a bar chart will pop up!

## What the Code Does
Here’s a quick breakdown:
Reads the Excel File: Opens your file from /data/ and turns it into a table.
Cleans the Data: Fixes messy stuff—like splitting region codes and names, and turning text numbers into real numbers.
Analyzes: Counts things (e.g., total businesses) and finds the top 10 regions and industries.
Shows Results: Prints facts and draws a bar chart of the top 10 industries.

# The /data/ Folder
This is where your datasets live! For example, sheet1.xls should be placed here.
The Excel file should have data about businesses, with columns like “Region”, “Total”, and different industries (e.g., “Retail”, “Construction”).

If your file has a different name or format, update the file_path in some.py.

## Troubleshooting
“Permission denied” error?: Make sure your Excel file isn’t open in another program (like Excel) when you run the code.
No chart shows up?: Check that matplotlib is installed (pip install matplotlib).
File not found?: Double-check your file_path matches where your Excel file is.

##  Fun Things to Try
Change the file path to use a different Excel file.
Print more stuff: Add print(df) after each step in analyze_data.py to see the table change.
Make a pie chart: In the analyze_data function, change plot(kind='bar') to plot(kind='pie').


# Questions?
If you’re stuck or want to add something cool (like more charts!), ask your teacher or a friend. This project is all about learning by doing—so play around with it!
Happy coding, detectives! 🕵️‍♂️📊
